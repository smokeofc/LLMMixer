### Option 2: Using Visual Studio

1. Open `LLMMixer.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Press `F5` to build and run the application

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Start LLMMixer - all eight services will load automatically
2. **Login to Services**: Click on each panel to log into the respective AI service
3. **Toggle Services**: Click "Services ‚ñº" dropdown menu and use checkboxes to show/hide individual services
4. **Refresh Individual Service**: Click the üîÑ button next to any service name to refresh just that service
5. **Reorder Services**: Click and drag a service name (not the refresh button) to reorder panels
6. **Resize Panels**: Drag the splitters between panels to adjust their width
7. **Refresh All Services**: Click "Refresh All" to reload all active services at once
8. **Start New Chat on All**: Click "Start New Chat on All" to navigate all services back to their landing pages for fresh conversations
9. **Reset Layout**: Click "Reset Layout" to restore default settings

**Note**: To drag and reorder services, click and hold on the service name text (e.g., "ChatGPT", "Claude"), not the refresh button. The cursor will change to a hand when hovering over draggable areas.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **F5**: Refresh all services (when focused on main window)
- **Alt+F4**: Close application

### Settings Storage

Settings are automatically saved to:
```
%APPDATA%\LLMMixer\settings.json
```

This includes:
- Service visibility states
- Panel widths
- Service order

**Migration from older versions**: If you're upgrading from a version with 4 or 6 services, your settings will be automatically migrated to support 8 services while preserving your visibility preferences. If you experience any issues after upgrading, you can delete the settings file to start fresh.

## Troubleshooting

### Service Mapping Issues

If buttons are opening the wrong services after an upgrade:

1. Close the application
2. Navigate to `%APPDATA%\LLMMixer\`
3. Delete `settings.json`
4. Restart the application

This will create fresh settings with the correct service mapping.

### WebView2 Not Found

If you get an error about WebView2 Runtime not being installed:

1. Download and install [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
2. Restart the application

### Services Not Loading

- Check your internet connection
- Try clicking "Refresh All" button
- Some services may require VPN in certain regions
- Clear browser cache by deleting the WebView2 user data folder:
  ```
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\LLMMixer\
  ```

### Login Issues

- You need to log into each service individually within the app
- Login sessions are maintained by WebView2 (similar to Microsoft Edge browser)
- If you're logged out unexpectedly, try logging in again
